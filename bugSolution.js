The solution focuses on improving the `FlatList` component's performance and rendering by addressing key management and simplifying item components.  Here's how:

1. **Unique Keys:** Ensure that `keyExtractor` provides a unique key for each item. UUIDs are highly recommended.

2. **Efficient Rendering:** Simplify the components rendered within each `FlatList` item. Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing or using `useMemo` hooks.

3. **Pagination or Virtualization:** Consider implementing pagination or virtualization techniques for extremely large datasets. This approach will load and render only the visible items, improving performance significantly.

Here's an example of a more efficient `FlatList` implementation:

```javascript
import uuid from 'uuid'; //Use a library for better UUID generation

<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <EfficientComponent item={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => uuid()}
/>
```

In `EfficientComponent`, optimize rendering to reduce unnecessary computations.  Use React memoization techniques for improved efficiency.
