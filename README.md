# React Native FlatList Rendering Errors

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue encountered when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with large datasets.  The problem is characterized by rendering errors or performance degradation due to inefficient key management or complex item components.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains code that reproduces the problem.  When a large dataset is used with the `FlatList`, rendering errors may occur, or the application may become unresponsive.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution.  Key optimizations are applied to `FlatList`'s `keyExtractor` prop, and item rendering is simplified to improve performance.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
4. Observe the performance and rendering behavior with the initial `bug.js` code.
5. Compare this behavior with the improved performance provided by `bugSolution.js`.
