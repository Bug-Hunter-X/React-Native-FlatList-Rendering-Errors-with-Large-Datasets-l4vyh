This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The error message may vary, but it generally points to issues with rendering and performance.  The issue is often caused by improper key management within the `FlatList` component or by rendering excessively complex components in each item. Consider the following example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ComplexComponent item={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```

If `item.id` is not unique or if `ComplexComponent` is computationally expensive to render, performance issues and rendering errors will arise.
